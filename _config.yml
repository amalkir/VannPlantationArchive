description: "This digital archive traces the history of Rivers Correctional Institution site in Hertford County, North Carolinaâ€”a private federal prison built in 2001 to incarcerate noncitizens and closed in 2022"
description_long: "From Plantation to Prison is a digital archive and interpretive exhibit that explores the layered history of the site now occupied by the Rivers Correctional Institution (RCI) in Hertford County, North Carolina. Built in 2001 as a private federal prison for noncitizens and closed in 2022, RCI was constructed on the grounds of the former Vann Plantation. Today, a prison watchtower overlooks an antebellum cemetery, embedding the legacies of slavery and immigrant incarceration within a single landscape. This project invites visitors to engage with the dissonant temporalities of plantation and prison, offering a space for public history, pedagogy, and reflection."
